        <h2>2. What We Do</h2>
        <p>
          Veracity Expert Witness is an expert witness agency. We handle
          the sourcing, vetting, engagement, scheduling, logistics, and compliance requirements
          for expert witness testimony on behalf of legal professionals. Our Services include
          coordinating all aspects of expert witness engagements from initial case assessment
          through courtroom delivery.

          <strong>What we are not:</strong> We are not a lawyer referral service and are not
          certified by the State Bar of California. We do not provide legal advice, legal
          representation, or legal opinions. Nothing on this Site should be treated as legal
          advice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our fees are independent service fees for expert witness solutions. They are not a
          share of legal fees or any fees paid in the context of legal representation.

        <h2>5. How We Handle Expert Witness Engagements</h2>

        <h3>5.1 Finding the Right Expert</h3>
        <p>
          We work to match you with expert witnesses who have the knowledge, skill, experience,
          training, or education needed for your case, consistent with California Evidence Code
          Section 720. However, we cannot guarantee the availability, qualifications, or
          performance of any expert witness.
        </p>

        <h3>5.2 Conflict Screening</h3>
        <p>
          Before making introductions, we screen for conflicts of interest, including prior
          involvement in the same or related matters and relationships with adverse parties.
          That said, you are still responsible for independently verifying potential conflicts,
          consistent with your professional obligations.
        </p>

        <h3>5.3 Engagement Coordination</h3>
        <p>
          Once you select an expert, we handle the engagement logistics &mdash; including contracts,
          scheduling, coordination between parties, and compliance with applicable requirements.
          We coordinate deposition preparation, report timelines, and trial scheduling so that
          all parties stay aligned.
        </p>

        <h3>5.4 Compensation Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          Expert witness compensation may be subject to disclosure during legal proceedings
          under California Evidence Code Section 722(b). You are responsible for ensuring
          compliance with all applicable disclosure requirements.
        </p>

        <h3>5.5 Your Relationship with the Expert</h3>
        <p>
          While we handle the logistics and coordination, the professional relationship between
          you and your expert witness is independent of Veracity. We are not a party to the
          engagement agreement between you and the expert and are not responsible for the
          expert&rsquo;s performance or the outcome of your case.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="legal-section">
        <h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
          We treat all case information as confidential. We will not disclose your case details
          to anyone other than potential expert witnesses being evaluated for your engagement,
          unless required by law.
        </p>
        <p>
          You acknowledge that sharing case information with potential experts is a necessary
          part of the matching and engagement process.
        </p>

        <h3>Medical Information</h3>
        <p>
          When case details include medical or health-related information, we handle it in
          accordance with HIPAA and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act.
          We are prepared to enter into Business Associate Agreements where required. You are
          responsible for ensuring that any medical information you share with us is disclosed
          in compliance with applicable law.
