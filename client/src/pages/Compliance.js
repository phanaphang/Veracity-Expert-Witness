        <h2>1. Our Commitment</h2>
        <p>
          Veracity Expert Witness is committed to operating in full compliance with all
          applicable laws and industry standards. This page outlines how we approach
          compliance across the key areas of our expert witness services,
          operating in Los Angeles, California.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are an expert witness agency &mdash; not a lawyer referral
          service. We handle the sourcing, engagement, scheduling, logistics, and compliance
          requirements for expert witness testimony. We are not certified by the State Bar of
          California and do not provide legal advice.

        <h2>2. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>

        <h3>How We Handle Your Data</h3>
        <p>
          We comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act as amended by the California
          Privacy Rights Act (CCPA/CPRA). In practice, this means:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We are transparent about what information we collect and why</li>
          <li>We honor your rights to access, delete, and correct your personal information</li>
          <li>We do not sell your personal information</li>
          <li>We honor Global Privacy Control signals from your browser</li>
          <li>We only use sensitive information (like health-related case details) to provide the services you requested</li>
          <li>We keep your data secure and limit access to authorized personnel</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Our Data Principles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Collect only what we need:</strong> We do not gather more information than necessary to support your engagement</li>
          <li><strong>Use it for what we said:</strong> We only use your data for the purposes we described</li>
          <li><strong>Don&rsquo;t keep it forever:</strong> We have clear retention periods and securely delete data when it is no longer needed</li>

        <h2>3. Medical Information</h2>

        <h3>HIPAA</h3>
        <p>
          While we are not a HIPAA-covered entity, we often handle engagements that involve
          medical case details. When protected health information is involved, we:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Treat all health-related information as strictly confidential</li>
          <li>Limit access to authorized personnel only</li>
          <li>Are prepared to sign Business Associate Agreements when required</li>
          <li>Ensure expert witnesses who receive medical information are bound by confidentiality obligations</li>
          <li>Securely dispose of medical information when no longer needed</li>
          <li>Report any unauthorized disclosure</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>California Medical Privacy (CMIA)</h3>
        <p>
          We comply with the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which
          provides strong protections for medical information. We do not disclose medical
          information without proper authorization and limit its use to purposes directly
          related to your expert witness engagement.

        <h2>4. Expert Witness Standards</h2>

        <h3>How We Select Experts</h3>
        <p>
          Our sourcing and vetting process is guided by the California Evidence Code standards
          for expert witness testimony:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We seek experts with the knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to qualify on the subject matter (Evidence Code Section 720)</li>
          <li>We support transparency in expert compensation, recognizing that fees are subject to disclosure during proceedings (Evidence Code Section 722)</li>
          <li>We help facilitate compliance with expert witness declaration and exchange requirements</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Conflict of Interest Screening</h3>
        <p>
          Before making any introduction, we screen for potential conflicts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We check for prior involvement in the same or related matters</li>
          <li>We look for relationships with adverse parties or counsel</li>
          <li>We review prior testimony history to identify potential issues</li>
          <li>We disclose any identified concerns to you before proceeding</li>
          <li>You retain ultimate responsibility for independently verifying conflicts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fee Transparency</h3>
        <p>
          Our fee practices are designed to be straightforward and independent:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our service fees are separate from legal fees &mdash; we do not take a share of fees paid in the context of legal representation</li>
          <li>We provide clear fee schedules for our services</li>
          <li>We do not receive compensation tied to case outcomes</li>
          <li>We disclose any financial relationships between our agency and referred experts</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Credential Verification and Ethical Standards</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We take reasonable steps to verify expert qualifications, credentials, and licensure</li>
          <li>We make objective recommendations based on case needs, not financial incentives</li>
          <li>We maintain strict confidentiality of all client and case information</li>
          <li>We are transparent about our processes and relationships</li>
        </ul>
