        <h2>7. Medical and Health-Related Information</h2>
        <p>
          In the course of providing expert witness solutions, we may receive case details that include
          medical or health-related information. We treat all such information as strictly
          confidential.
        </p>

        <h3>7.1 HIPAA</h3>
        <p>
          While we are not a HIPAA-covered entity, we recognize that case details may include
          protected health information. When that happens, we are prepared to enter into Business
          Associate Agreements and apply HIPAA-level safeguards, including limiting access to
          authorized personnel and ensuring expert witnesses are bound by confidentiality
          obligations.
        </p>

        <h3>7.2 California Medical Privacy Law (CMIA)</h3>
        <p>
          We comply with the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which
          provides strong protections for medical information. We do not disclose medical
          information without proper authorization, and we limit its use to purposes directly
          related to your expert witness engagement.
